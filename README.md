## Data analysis

Structured data lends itself easily to data analysis.  The following are some
ideas about how our data could be harnessed:

- to produce plenary attendance statistics (per party and MP; seasonal
  trends; etc.), and similarly with questions (e.g. by plotting question
  frequency against time);
- to identify MPs' topics of interest by [analysing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
  the text of their questions;
- to calculate MPs' average tenure and see how it compares with the rest of the
  world.
